# 99-en Help

Basically, if it doesn't work, you can look at the output or the error log, but I will note what seems to happen most often.

## Featuring ROS2

```bash
cargo build --release --features ros2
cargo install --path ./openrr-apps
```

Please make sure that ROS2 is enabled before these commands.

## GUI Troubleshooting

Please check openrr-gui [README](https://github.com/openrr/openrr/tree/main/openrr-gui#troubleshooting)

## Somthing

## If this does not resolve the issue

It may be a bug in OpenRR, so it would be helpful if you could open an Issue in the repository [Issues](https://github.com/openrr/openrr/issues).
